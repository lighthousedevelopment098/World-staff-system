          You can obtain a student visa by enrolling in a Japanese language
          school, which will support you from the visa process through your
          arrival in Japan. The school provides comprehensive guidance on life
          and career, with opportunities to take the JLPT and EJU exams up to
          four times each over two years. Beyond class hours, youâ€™ll also deepen
          your understanding of Japanese society and build communication skills
          through cultural experiences and part-time work.
